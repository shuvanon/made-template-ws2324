# Project Plan

## Title
The Exploring the Intersection of Weather Conditions and Road Speed Limits


## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does temperature affect the occurrence of speeding?
2. Is there a correlation between wind conditions and instances of exceeding the speed limit?
3. Does precipitation have any impact on the likelihood of traffic fines due to speeding in the Bonn city area?
4. Are there any patterns or trends in the data that suggest a consistent relationship between weather variables (temperature, wind, precipitation) and traffic violations related to speeding?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

This study investigates the correlation between weather conditions and speed limits on roads within the Bonn city area. Additionally, it examines instances of traffic fines resulting from exceeding speed limits, exploring their relationship with temperature, wind, and precipitation on specific dates throughout the year 2022, spanning from January to December.
